Waunsterw is a brand new development of seven spacious family homes, nestled in the hills above Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, yet only 10 minutes from the M4 motorway. With the golden sands of Gower beaches and the rolling hills of Brecon all within easy reach, Waunsterw has exactly what you’re looking for.
The town centre, less than a mile away, is home to a range of local shops including a bakery and a butcher as well as banks, several restaurants and pubs. Pontardawe also boasts a leisure centre, a swimming pool and an arts centre where you can see all the latest films.
A Tesco superstore is conveniently located just outside the town centre and for a wider range of shops, both Neath town centre and Swansea City Centre are less than a 20 minute drive away.
For those with families the local area is well served for schools, with Rhydyfro Primary School less than a 10 minute walk away, and the highly rated Cwmtawe Community School for secondary age pupils also just a mile away.
